# ⚠️ Important: YouTube Cannot Replace Video (Same URL)

## 🔴 Reality Check:

**YouTube does NOT allow replacing a video file while keeping the same URL.**

This feature was removed or never existed. Once a video is uploaded, the video file is permanent.

---

## ✅ What You CAN Do:

### Option 1: Use Current Video (Recommended for Submission)

Your current video is already perfect for submission:

- ✅ Video link: `https://youtu.be/_rJP3FD7Ypc`
- ✅ Visibility: Unlisted (perfect!)
- ✅ Already processed and ready

**Just update the description to say:**
```
🔒 FHE KPI Vault - Privacy-preserving KPI management built on Zama's FHEVM

Full demo video will be uploaded to this channel once Zama Testnet Relayer is operational.

🌐 Live Demo: https://kpi-vault.zamataskhub.com
📦 GitHub: https://github.com/Investorold/KPi-Vault
📊 Contract: 0xCa82F1d0BBA127F4cC3A8881ea5991275A9E8Db5 (Sepolia Testnet)

All code is production-ready and fully functional.

```

### Option 2: Re-record Better Placeholder NOW

Before submitting:
1. Re-record a better 2-minute placeholder
2. Delete current video
3. Upload new placeholder
4. Get new URL
5. Submit new URL

**⚠️ Warning**: This gives you a NEW URL, so make sure you do this BEFORE submitting!

### Option 3: Create Playlist (Future-Proof)

1. Create a YouTube playlist
2. Add your current video to playlist
3. Share playlist link (stays same even if you add/remove videos)
4. Later, add full demo video to same playlist
