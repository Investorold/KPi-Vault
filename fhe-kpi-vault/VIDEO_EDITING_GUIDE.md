## 🎯 What to Cut (Target: 7-8 minutes)

### **Cut These:**
- ❌ Long pauses before clicking buttons (keep it snappy)
- ❌ Waiting for MetaMask popup to appear (cut to just showing the popup)
- ❌ Waiting for blockchain transactions (use jump cut - show "submitting..." then immediately "confirmed")
- ❌ "Umm", "uhh", or thinking pauses
- ❌ Repetitive explanations (explain once, show it working)
- ❌ Browser loading/refresh times
- ❌ Multiple entries if showing the same thing (show 1-2, mention you can add more)

### **Keep These:**
- ✅ Clear introduction (30 seconds)
- ✅ Showing MetaMask popup during encryption (important!)
- ✅ Showing encrypted → decrypted transition (the "magic" moment)
- ✅ Access control demonstration (granting access)
- ✅ Wallet switching (show viewer mode working)
- ✅ Notification bell (if you included it)
- ✅ Closing summary

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start rough, then refine**: First pass - cut obvious dead time. Second pass - fine-tune.

2. **Jump cuts are your friend**: Instead of waiting 30 seconds for a transaction, cut from "submitting" → "confirmed" instantly.

3. **Keep the energy up**: Fast-paced = more engaging (but not too fast!)

4. **Test export early**: Export a small section first to check quality before processing the whole video.

5. **Save your project**: CapCut saves projects so you can go back and re-edit if needed.
