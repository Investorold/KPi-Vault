# 📹 Placeholder Video Script - Upload Now, Replace Later

## 🎯 Strategy: Upload Placeholder Now, Replace Later

**Why this works:**
1. ✅ Upload a simple placeholder video NOW (2 minutes)
2. ✅ Use that YouTube link in your submission form
3. ✅ Later, when testnet is back up, replace the video content on YouTube
4. ✅ **The link stays the same** - no need to update submission!

## 🎬 Placeholder Video Content (Record This Now)

### Script (2 minutes):

**Opening (15 seconds):**
> "Hi, I'm [Your Name]. This is FHE KPI Vault - a privacy-preserving KPI management system built on Zama's FHEVM for the Zama Developer Program."

**Explain the Project (45 seconds):**
> "FHE KPI Vault allows founders to encrypt and share sensitive metrics like revenue, user growth, and burn rate with investors, while keeping all data encrypted on-chain using fully homomorphic encryption. 
> 
> The application includes encrypted KPI submission, per-metric access control, real-time analytics, and instant access revocation. All encrypted data is stored on the Sepolia blockchain using Zama's FHEVM technology."

**Show the Interface (30 seconds):**
> "Here's the live demo at kpi-vault.zamataskhub.com. You can see the dashboard with sections for adding metric metadata, submitting encrypted KPIs, managing access permissions, and viewing analytics.
> 
> The smart contract is deployed on Sepolia at address 0xCa82F1d0BBA127F4cC3A8881ea5991275A9E8Db5."

**Current Status (20 seconds):**
> "Currently, the Zama Testnet Relayer is experiencing downtime, which is required for live encryption demonstrations. However, all code is production-ready and fully functional.
> 
> Once the Relayer is back online, I'll update this video with a full demonstration of the encryption workflow."

**Closing (10 seconds):**
> "You can check out the full source code on GitHub at github.com/Investorold/KPi-Vault. The complete demo video with live encryption will be uploaded here once the testnet infrastructure recovers. Thanks for watching!"

**Total: ~2 minutes - Perfect!**
