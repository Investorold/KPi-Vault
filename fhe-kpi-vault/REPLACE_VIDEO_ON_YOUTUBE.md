2. **Confirm replacement**

## 🎬 Alternative: If Replace Isn't Available

If YouTube doesn't offer "Replace video" option (rare, but possible):

**Workaround:**
1. Download your current video (backup)
2. Delete the current video
3. Upload new video
4. Use the new URL (but you'll need to update submission)

**⚠️ Warning**: This gives you a NEW URL, so you'd need to update your submission form if possible.
