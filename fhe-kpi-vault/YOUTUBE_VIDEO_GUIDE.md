### 📝 Step 2: Create a Simple Placeholder Video (If Needed Now)

Since the Relayer might be down, you can create a quick 30-60 second placeholder:

**Script for Placeholder Video:**
```
"Hi, this is [Your Name] with the FHE KPI Vault project.

This is a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) application that allows 
companies to securely record and analyze KPI metrics without exposing 
sensitive data.

Due to the Zama Relayer being temporarily unavailable during submission,
I'm unable to demonstrate live encryption at this moment. However, once
the Relayer is back online, you can see the full functionality at:

https://kpi-vault.zamataskhub.com

The complete demo video will be uploaded shortly. Thank you for your 
understanding!"
```

**Then:**
1. Record yourself saying this (or record your screen showing the README)
2. Keep it under 2 minutes
3. Save the video file

### 🎥 Step 3: Upload to YouTube

1. **Go to YouTube**
   - Visit: https://www.youtube.com
   - Sign in with your Google account (create one if needed)

2. **Create Channel** (If First Time)
   - Click your profile picture (top right)
   - Click "Create a channel"
   - Choose a name (can be your name or "Project Demos")
   - Click "Create channel"

3. **Upload Video**
   - Click the camera icon (top right) → "Upload video"
   - Or go directly to: https://www.youtube.com/upload

4. **Select Your Video File**
   - Drag & drop your video file
   - Or click "SELECT FILES" and choose your video
   - Wait for upload (may take a few minutes)

5. **Configure Video Settings**
   - **Title**: "FHE KPI Vault - Demo Video" (or similar)
   - **Description**: Add a brief description
   - **Visibility**: Select **"Unlisted"** (Important!)
     - This means only people with the link can see it
     - Your video won't appear in public searches
   - Click "Next" through other steps (tags optional)

6. **Publish**
   - Click "Publish" when ready
   - YouTube will process the video (may take 5-15 minutes)

### 🔗 Step 4: Get Your Video Link

1. **Once Published**
   - Go to your YouTube Studio: https://studio.youtube.com
   - Click "Content" in left sidebar
   - Find your video

2. **Copy the Link**
   - Click on your video
   - Copy the URL from the address bar
   - Example: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abc123xyz`
