### 3. **IMPORTANT: Change Visibility to "Unlisted"** ⚠️

Currently it says "Saved as private". 

**Before clicking "Next" or "Publish":**
- Click on the "Saved as private" button (or go to the "Visibility" step)
- Change it to **"Unlisted"** (NOT "Private"!)
- **Unlisted** = Anyone with the link can view (perfect for submission)
- **Private** = Only you can view (won't work for submission)

### 4. **Set a Thumbnail** (Optional but Recommended)

- Click "Upload file" to add a custom thumbnail
- Or use the "Auto-generated" option (already selected)
- A good thumbnail helps when people click your link

### 5. **Continue Through Steps:**

- Click "Next" through:
  - "Video elements" (optional)
  - "Checks" (automatic)
  - "Visibility" → **Make sure it's "Unlisted"!**

### 6. **Publish and Get Link:**

- Click "Publish" or "Schedule"
- Wait for processing to complete
- **Copy the video link**: `https://youtu.be/_rJP3FD7Ypc`
- This is your submission link! ✅
