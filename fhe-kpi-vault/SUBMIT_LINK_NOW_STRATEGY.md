# 🎯 Strategy: Get YouTube Link NOW, Upload Video Later

## ✅ The Plan:

1. **NOW**: Upload a placeholder to YouTube → Get the link
2. **NOW**: Submit that link in the form (can't change later)
3. **LATER**: When testnet is back, upload real video to **same link**

**Key Point**: YouTube keeps the **same URL** when you replace video content!

## 🚀 Step 1: Upload Placeholder NOW (5 minutes)

### Create Simple Placeholder Video:

**Option A: Text-Only Placeholder**
1. Create a simple 30-second video saying:
   > "Hi, this is [Your Name] with FHE KPI Vault. This video will be uploaded shortly. Full demo coming soon. Check out the live demo at kpi-vault.zamataskhub.com"

**Option B: Screenshot Slide**
1. Take a screenshot of your app
2. Create a 30-second video showing the screenshot with text overlay
3. Use any video editor (even Windows Movie Maker or iMovie)

**Option C: Screen Recording (Fastest)**
1. Record 30 seconds of your screen showing:
   - The live demo URL in browser
   - Navigate to GitHub repo
   - Say the script above

### Upload to YouTube:

1. Go to **YouTube.com** → Sign in
2. Click **camera icon** (top right) → **"Upload video"**
3. **Drag your placeholder video** (or click "SELECT FILES")
4. **While uploading, fill in:**
   - **Title**: `FHE KPI Vault - Demo Video`
   - **Description**:
     ```

   - Click "Next" through other steps
5. Click **"Publish"**
6. **Wait for processing** (5-15 minutes)
7. **COPY THE URL** - This is your submission link! ✅

**Example URL format**: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abc123xyz`

---

## 📝 Step 2: Submit the Link NOW

Use that YouTube URL in your submission form. **This link cannot be changed after submission.**

---

## 🔄 Step 3: Later - Replace Video Content (Same Link!)

When Zama Testnet is back up and you've recorded the full demo:

### Method 1: Replace Video (Recommended)

1. **Go to YouTube Studio**: https://studio.youtube.com
2. **Click "Content"** (left sidebar)
3. **Find your video** (the placeholder one)
4. **Click on the video** to open it
5. **Click "Editor" tab** (or look for "Replace video" option)
6. **Click "Replace video"** button
7. **Select your new video file** (full demo with encryption)
8. **YouTube will replace it** - **URL stays exactly the same!** ✅
9. **Update description** (optional):
   - Remove "coming soon" text
   - Add full feature list
   - Add timestamps

### Method 2: Delete & Re-upload (NOT Recommended)

⚠️ **Don't do this!** If you delete and re-upload, you'll get a NEW URL.

## ✅ Verification Steps:

**BEFORE Submitting:**
- [ ] Placeholder video uploaded to YouTube
- [ ] Video set to "Unlisted"
- [ ] Copied the YouTube URL
- [ ] Test the link - it should work (even if video is just a placeholder)
- [ ] Ready to submit! ✅

**AFTER Submitting (When Testnet Back):**
- [ ] Record full demo video
- [ ] Go to YouTube Studio
- [ ] Find your video
- [ ] Click "Replace video"
- [ ] Upload new video file
- [ ] Verify same URL still works
- [ ] Done! ✅

---

## 💡 Important Notes:

1. **URL Never Changes**: When you replace video content, YouTube keeps the exact same URL
2. **Unlisted is Perfect**: Only people with the link can see it (perfect for submission)
3. **Update Anytime**: You can replace the video content as many times as needed
4. **Keep Same Title**: Don't change the title dramatically - keeps it recognizable

## 🎬 What Your Placeholder Should Include:

**Minimum (30 seconds):**
- Your name/introduction
- Project name: "FHE KPI Vault"
- Mention it's for Zama Developer Program
- Say "Full demo coming soon"
- Link to live demo: kpi-vault.zamataskhub.com

**Better (1-2 minutes):**
- Everything above PLUS:
- Show the live demo interface
- Explain key features
- Show GitHub repo
- Mention contract address

---

## 📋 Quick Checklist:

**RIGHT NOW:**
- [ ] Record 30-second to 2-minute placeholder
- [ ] Upload to YouTube as "Unlisted"
- [ ] Copy the YouTube URL
- [ ] Submit that URL in the form ✅

**LATER (When Testnet Back):**
- [ ] Record full demo (5-10 minutes)
- [ ] Go to YouTube Studio
- [ ] Replace video content (same URL)
- [ ] Update description
- [ ] Done! ✅

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Test the Link First!

Before submitting:
1. Copy the YouTube URL
2. Open it in an incognito/private window
3. Make sure it works (shows your placeholder video)
4. Only then use it in submission!

**This strategy lets you submit NOW and improve the video LATER - all with the same link!** 🎯
