## Why are you interested in joining the Ritual Builders Program?

I'm fascinated by the intersection of blockchain, cryptography, and AI—especially privacy-preserving computation. Over the past two months, I've been building production dApps using Zama's FHEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) and experienced firsthand how powerful encrypted computation can be when combined with decentralized infrastructure.

Ritual's vision of decentralized, AI-native infrastructure resonates deeply with me because I've seen the limitations of centralized systems firsthand—whether it's trusting third-party servers, dealing with infrastructure downtime, or the privacy concerns of traditional AI services. The idea of building applications where AI models and inference can run in a trustless, decentralized manner is exactly the kind of frontier I want to explore.

I'm particularly excited about:
- Working with fellow builders who are pushing boundaries
- Experimenting on testnet with cutting-edge technology
- Helping shape what decentralized intelligence looks like
- Contributing to documentation and developer tooling
- Building Ritual-native applications that demonstrate practical use cases

As someone who learns by building, I see this program as a chance to contribute meaningfully while growing alongside the ecosystem. I'm not looking for handouts—I'm looking for a community where I can roll up my sleeves and help bring decentralized intelligence to life.

## Have you participated in any hackathons?

**No** - I haven't participated in hackathons yet, but I'm very interested in doing so.

I've been focused on building production-quality applications rather than hackathon prototypes. My approach has been to create fully functional, well-documented, and tested applications that solve real problems. However, I recognize that hackathons offer unique value:

- Rapidly prototype new ideas
- Collaborate with other builders
- Get feedback on concepts quickly
- Network with the community
- Learn new technologies under time pressure

I'm planning to participate in upcoming hackathons, especially those focused on:
- Privacy-preserving technology
- AI and machine learning
- Decentralized infrastructure
- Blockchain and cryptography

I believe my experience building production applications will be valuable in hackathon settings, and I'm excited to bring that practical knowledge to rapid prototyping scenarios.

## Have you led technical workshops before?

**No** - I haven't led workshops yet, but I'm very interested in doing so and believe I'm ready.

I've been documenting my learning journey extensively, which has given me experience in:
- Breaking down complex concepts into understandable steps
- Writing comprehensive technical documentation
- Creating step-by-step guides and tutorials
- Explaining FHE and blockchain concepts to others
- Documenting both successes and failures for learning

I believe teaching is one of the best ways to learn, and I'd love to lead workshops on:
- Building with FHE/privacy-preserving technology
- Integrating decentralized AI into applications
- Practical web3 development workflows
- My experience building with Zama FHEVM
- Navigating SDK migrations and infrastructure challenges
- Best practices for production dApp development

I'm ready to step into this role and contribute to the community's learning. My approach would be hands-on, practical, and based on real-world experience rather than theoretical knowledge.

## Were you referred by anyone?

**No** - I discovered Ritual independently and was drawn to the program after learning about the vision for decentralized AI infrastructure.

I've been following developments in privacy-preserving computation and decentralized infrastructure, and Ritual's approach to combining AI with blockchain technology aligns perfectly with my interests and experience. I'm applying because I genuinely believe in the mission and want to contribute to building the future of AI-native decentralized applications.

## Anything else you want to share with us for your application?

I'm an aspiring developer who learns by building. I don't have a traditional CS background or formal work experience, but I've proven I can ship production applications that solve real problems.

**What Sets Me Apart:**

1. **Building Real Products**: I've deployed fully functional dApps that use cutting-edge cryptography (FHE) to solve real-world problems. My FHE KPI Vault isn't a tutorial project—it's a working application with comprehensive features, full test coverage, and production deployment.

2. **Problem-Solving Mindset**: When Zama's infrastructure had downtime, I didn't just wait. I built automatic retry logic, gateway failover systems, and comprehensive error handling to make my application resilient. I solve problems, not just build features.

3. **Learning Publicly**: I document everything—my successes, failures, and the problems I solve. This helps me learn and helps others who face similar challenges. My GitHub and documentation reflect this commitment to transparency.

4. **Persistence & Resilience**: I've navigated major SDK migrations (FHEVM v0.8 → v0.9), infrastructure issues, and complex debugging. I don't give up when things get hard—I figure it out. The "Incorrect Handle" error haunted me for days, but I solved it.

5. **Community Mindset**: I believe in open-source, sharing knowledge, and helping others. All my code is public, and I'm always willing to help fellow builders. I contribute back to the communities that help me grow.

6. **Production Experience**: I've built applications that handle real-world scenarios:
   - Infrastructure failures and retry logic
   - SDK migrations and version management
   - Error handling and user feedback
   - Comprehensive testing and documentation
   - Deployment and monitoring

**Why Ritual Matters to Me:**

I see Ritual as the next evolution of what I've been building with. While FHE enables encrypted computation, Ritual enables decentralized AI inference. The combination of these technologies could unlock entirely new categories of applications that are both private and intelligent.

I'm particularly excited about:
- Combining FHE with decentralized AI inference
- Building applications that are both private and intelligent
- Contributing to the infrastructure that makes this possible
- Learning from and collaborating with other builders

**My Approach:**

I'm not looking for handouts—I'm looking for a community where I can contribute meaningfully while growing. I bring:
- Practical experience building with cutting-edge cryptography
- A builder's mindset focused on solving real problems
- Genuine passion for privacy-preserving and decentralized technology
- Willingness to learn, document, and share knowledge
- Resilience and problem-solving skills

I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and help bring decentralized intelligence to life. I believe in Ritual's vision, and I'm excited about the possibility of contributing to this frontier.
